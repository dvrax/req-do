# Req(uest)-Do(er)

At present, this is the most useless alternative to a browser's "view source"
functionality.

## Future goals:

* Do requests other than GETs
  * Be able to specify a body for the request
* Add custom headers to requests
* Pretty format json output
* View headers of responses
* And a whole lot more...
